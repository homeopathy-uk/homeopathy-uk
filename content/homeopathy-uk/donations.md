#### Making a pledge

If you would like to remember Homeopathy UK in your will, there are several kinds of legacy you can leave. A **residual legacy**is a bequest of part of, or the remainder of, your estate once your family have been provided for. A **pecuniary legacy**is a specified sum of money determined when the will or codicil is written. A **specific legacy**is the gift of a particular item of value.

If you are thinking of making a pledge, or have already done so, it would really help us to know.
