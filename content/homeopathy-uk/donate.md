Homeopathy UK is funded entirely by donations. There are a number of ways you can help support our important work.

**Leave a legacy**

By remembering Homeopathy UK in your will, you can help ensure that the benefits of homeopathy are available for generations to come. It will cost you nothing today but will make all the difference to the future of Homeopathy UK.

If you would like to remember Homeopathy UK in your will, there are several kinds of legacy you can leave. A **residual legacy** is a bequest of part of, or the remainder of, your estate once your family have been provided for. A **pecuniary legacy** is a specified sum of money determined when the will or codicil is written. A **specific legacy**is the gift of a particular item of value.

If you are thinking of making a pledge, or have already done so, it would really help us to know. You can tell us by either completing the [Statement of intent form](https://res.cloudinary.com/homeopathyuk/v1557403245/bha/Legacy_leaflet_insert.pdf) or fill in the contact form below and we'll be in touch. Please be assured that any statement of intent is not binding. It will simply help us to plan our future work with confidence.
