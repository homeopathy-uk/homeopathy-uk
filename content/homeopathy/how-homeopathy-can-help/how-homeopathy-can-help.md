**How homeopathy can help**

Homeopathic doctors often see patients with long-term, chronic problems, many of which have failed to respond to conventional medicine. Homeopathy has been successfully used to treat a range of illnesses and conditions including: eczema, chronic fatigue syndrome, osteoarthritis, anxiety attacks, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, and menopausal symptoms. It can also be effective in the treatment of minor ailments, from cuts and bruises to coughs and colds. Homeopathy is also popular with patients who want to limit the side-effects of standard cancer treatments.

However, since homeopathy is designed to treat the whole person it can be considered in almost any situation where a person’s health is depleted.

Despite the differences in approach, homeopathic and conventional treatments can work very well alongside each other. A medical doctor trained in homeopathy will know when it is most effective to use homeopathic medicine, conventional medicine or a combination of both. Our Homeopathy UK charitable clinics {LINK TO CLINICS PAGE} are staffed by GPs and medical professionals trained in homeopathy bringing patients the best of both worlds. You can also find details of other registered homeopaths across the UK by using our FindAHomeopath search tool {LINK TO FIND A HOMEOPATH PAGE}

What does homeopathic treatment involve?

Homeopathic doctors work in the same way as any other conventional doctors. History taking, examination and investigation are all important in establishing the diagnosis. However, as well as asking about your symptoms, a homeopathic doctor will be interested in you as an individual and the unique way in which your symptoms affect you.

The homeopathic consultation

Questions about your lifestyle, eating habits and preferences, temperament, personality, sleep patterns and medical history help the doctor to form a complete picture of you. This picture will be matched to the symptoms of your illness in order to prescribe a particular type and strength of homeopathic medicine.

As a guide your first appointment could take anything up to an hour, with follow-up appointments typically lasting 30 minutes. This does vary depending on the practitioner and the setting in which they work (NHS appointments may be shorter for example).

Preparing for your appointment

To get the most out of a consultation, it is helpful to make some notes beforehand and to think through all the issues that are affecting your health. Some homeopathic practitioners ask new patients to complete a questionnaire before their first appointment. This is a helpful way of saving time and to your advantage to do so if requested.

The medicine

At the end of the consultation your homeopathic doctor will give you a prescription and advise you how often to take the medicine. Homeopathy is usually taken in tablet or pillule, but is also available in liquid and powder form. You may be prescribed a homeopathic gel or cream for topical use as well.

Is homeopathy safe?

_Safe and effective_

Homeopathy is perfectly safe. This is because homeopathic medicines are made from a very small amount of the active ingredient. Two hundred years of practice, research and trials have proved the safety of this gentle system of medicine for both people and animals.

_Gentle and non-addictive_

Unlike some conventional drugs, homeopathic medicines are non-addictive and have no dangerous side-effects. Homeopathy is safe to use for babies children and pregnant or breastfeeding women, who are under the supervision of a homeopathic doctor.

_Regulated practice_

Members of the Faculty of Homeopathy are doctors and other statutorily registered healthcare professionals bound to act within the competence of their profession and their level of training and qualification in homeopathy. This means that a homeopathic medicine would not be prescribed when, for example, a conventional treatment is actually the better option for a patient.
