Homeopathic doctors often see patients with long-term, chronic problems, many of which have failed to respond to conventional medicine. Homeopathy has been successfully used to treat a range of illnesses and conditions including: eczema, chronic fatigue syndrome, osteoarthritis, anxiety attacks, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, and menopausal symptoms. It can also be effective in the treatment of minor ailments, from cuts and bruises to coughs and colds. Homeopathy is also popular with patients who want to limit the side-effects of standard cancer treatments.

Despite the differences in approach, homeopathic and conventional treatments can work very well alongside each other. A medical doctor trained in homeopathy will know when it is most effective to use homeopathic medicine, conventional medicine or a combination of both.

Our Homeopathy UK charitable clinics {LINK TO CLINICS PAGE} are staffed by GPs and medical professionals trained in homeopathy bringing patients the best of both worlds.

As well as doctors  many nurses, midwives, dentists, vets, pharmacists, podiatrists and osteopaths also use homeopathy in their daily practice.

You can find details of registered homeopaths across the UK by using our FindAHomeopath search tool {LINK TO FIND A HOMEOPATH PAGE}
