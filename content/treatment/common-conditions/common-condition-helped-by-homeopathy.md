Homeopathy is designed to treat the whole person and can potentially help in almost any situation where a person’s health is depleted. 

**Minor ailments and injuries** 

Homeopathy can be very useful in the treatment of minor ailments, from cuts and bruises to coughs and colds. A medical doctor trained in homeopathy will know when it is most effective to use homeopathic medicine, conventional medicine or a combination of both.

**Long term chronic conditions** 

Homeopathic doctors also see patients with long-term, chronic problems, many of which have failed to respond to conventional medicine. Studies conducted by the BHA in collaboration with members of the Faculty of Homeopathy identified the conditions most frequently seen by homeopathic doctors and dentists. These include: 

Allergy, anxiety, asthma, catarrh, chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic rhinitis, cough, Crohn’s disease, depression, Eczema, fibromyalgia, hay fever, headache, irritable bowel syndrome, menopausal symptoms, migraine, multiple sclerosis, osteoarthritis, premenstrual syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, upper respiratory tract infection, vitiligo.

**Dental conditions where homeopathy can help** 

Anxiety, apical abscess, gum swelling, pericoronitis, periodontal abscess, post-surgery pain, reversible pulpitis, sensitive cementum, tooth extraction, toothache with decay.

**Published clinical evidence for homeopathy** 

Homeopathic research is still in its infancy but several of the conditions above, and a number of others, have a published evidence base.
